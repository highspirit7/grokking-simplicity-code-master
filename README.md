# _Grokking Simplicity_

Welcome to _Grokking Simplicity_, a book about functional
programming by Eric Normand.

This source code distribution is a companion resource to
_Grokking Simplicity_ available from Manning. To purchase a
printed and/or electronic copy of the book, please visit
https://lispcast.com/gs

The book presents source code examples in JavaScript. I
never intended for anyone to run this code. Think of the
code as pseudocode. It is there only to illustrate the
various skills and concepts in the book. You may, however,
want to follow along with the refactorings on your own. So
the code is here.

I have organized the code in a hierarchical directory
structure with the following levels:

1. Programming language directory
2. Chapter directory
3. Section file

Each file is named with the following format:

```
{page number|page number range} {Section title}.{ext}
```

For example, this file:

```
JavaScript/Chapter 16/443-449 Building a queue in JavaScript.js
```

Indicates the JavaScript language, Chapter 16, pages
443-449, in a section titled "Building a queue in
JavaScript."

If you have code in other languages besides JavaScript, I'm
sure other readers would appreciate it. Please consider
adding it to this repository. Just create a pull request and
I'll check it out.
